# Notes

Assumes that Velocity.exe is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Silverlake Software LLC\Velocity`.

If this isn't the case, update the `.reg` files accordingly.

# Known Issues

This may or may not work depending on Windows version or configuration.

It's based on this comment which is 4 years old *(as of the date of this repo's initial commit)*:

https://github.com/gdelmas/IntelliJDashPlugin/issues/39#issuecomment-164648562

If this fix does not work by itself, a complete uninstall and reinstall of Velocity has done the trick for me recently.

# Contact Info

Velocity's author has a GitHub profile *(https://github.com/jdasilva)*, but there is no repo where you can raise issues because Velocity is not an open-source project.
